    "### Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is the act of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company.It represents a major challenge for telecommunications businesses. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, and high churn rates directly impact revenue, profitability, and brand perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the increasingly competitive telecom industry, companies must proactively identify customers at risk of churning and take steps to retain them. Traditional retention efforts, such as blanket discount offers or mass outreach, are often inefficient and costly. A data-driven, predictive approach offers a more effective solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model to **predict whether a customer is likely to churn**, based on their historical and behavioral data. By identifying at-risk customers before they churn, the business can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce customer acquisition costs by improving retention\n",
    "- Optimize marketing and customer service interventions\n",
    "- Personalize offers to customers who show warning signs\n",
    "- Understand key drivers of churn for long-term strategic planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stakeholders for this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Retention Team:** Needs early warnings to take preventive actions (e.g., loyalty offers).\n",
    "- **Marketing Team:** Can use model insights to target at-risk segments with personalized campaigns.\n",
    "- **Product Managers:** Gain insights on which service features drive churn to improve user experience.\n",
    "- **Senior Leadership:** Interested in revenue retention and strategic decision-making based on customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be considered successful if it can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurately classify customers as likely to churn or not (using precision, recall, and F1-score).\n",
    "- Provide interpretable results that highlight the most influential features.\n",
    "- Enable actionable recommendations to reduce churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project supports data-driven decision-making and cost-effective customer engagement in a highly competitive market.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is from **SyriaTel**, a telecommunications company. It contains customer demographic, behavioral, and account-related features. The target variable is Churn indicating whether a customer has left the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type**: Tabular\n",
    "- **Target variable**: Churn (Binary: 1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)\n",
    "- **Rows**: [Insert number of records]\n",
    "- **Columns**: [Insert number of features]\n",
    "- **Format**: CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The features fall into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics**: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents\n",
    "- **Service Features**: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport,StreamingTV, StreamingMovies\n",
    "- **Account Information**: tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerical**: tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, SeniorCitizen\n",
    "- **Categorical**: Contract, InternetService, PaymentMethod, etc.\n",
    "- **Boolean** (Yes/No): Several columns may be encoded as strings and will need encoding.\n",
    "- **Target**: Churn (Binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Look at the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before modeling, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect data types and basic statistics\n",
    "- Check for missing or malformed data\n",
    "- Understand value distributions\n",
    "- Identify categorical and numerical features\n",
    "- Explore class imbalance in the target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration helps us determine preprocessing strategies such as encoding, scaling, or imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Step Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding your dataset is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding data leakage**\n",
    "- **Choosing the right model and metrics**\n",
    "- **Improving interpretability**\n",
    "- **Avoiding common pitfalls like inconsistent data types, unexpected nulls, or mislabeled targets**\n"
